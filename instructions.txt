This should work with your default python environment, assuming you already have a recent version of pandas and pymongo installed. 

These are the preferred versions:
pandas==1.5.2
pymongo==3.12.0

You can confirm this in windows by opening a command prompt and typing:

pip3 list

Execution Steps:
1. Open a cmd window
2. Change directory to the directory where this script is stored
3. Run command "python get_nwc_data_by_timestamp.py"


If your default python environment is not set up, you can follow the steps below to run the script. 


To call this script from the command prompt and create a virtual environment for your dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Python script and requirements.txt are located.

2. Create a virtual environment:

	For Windows:

		python -m venv myenv

	For macOS/Linux:

		python3 -m venv myenv

	This will create a virtual environment called myenv in your current directory.

3. Activate the virtual environment:
	
	For Windows:

		myenv\Scripts\activate

	For macOS/Linux:

		source myenv/bin/activate

	Your command prompt should now show the virtual environment name, like (myenv).

4. Install the dependencies using the requirements.txt file:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run your Python script:
	
	For Windows:

		python get_nwc_data_by_timestamp.py

	For macOS/Linux:

		python3 get_nwc_data_by_timestamp.py

	This will execute your script, and the script will ask for the necessary inputs.

6. Remember to deactivate the virtual environment when you're done by simply typing deactivate in the command prompt.
